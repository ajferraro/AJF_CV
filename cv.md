I am a physical climate scientist with interests in the terrestrial
hydrological cycle and atmospheric radiative transfer. I use climate
model simulations in conjunction with remote sensing observations to
enhance fundamental physical understanding of the climate system. I
am also interested in the emerging technology of climate
geoengineering and how this interacts with conventional climate
policy.
